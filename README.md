# Firebase-Recipe-web
The Firebase Recipe App is a mobile application built using Flutter and Firebase Firestore that works as a personal recipe book. The main objective of the project is to demonstrate the use of Firebase for implementing the four fundamental CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete — in a real-time application.
